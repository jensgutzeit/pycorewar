README for PyCorewar 0.2.0

PyCorewar is a fast MARS with an easy to use Python interface. It is
released under The GNU General Public License, Version 2 (see the file
COPYING for details).

At the moment the following features are supported:

- ICWS '88 (with multiwarrior support)
- ICWS '94 draft (without P-Space)
- most features of pMARS' parser

Updates can be found at http://corewars.jgutzeit.de/pycorewar/index.en.html
For flames, comments and bug-reports send an email to jens@jgutzeit.de

The '88-MARS of PyCorewar (Corewar.Benchmarking.MARS_88) is about
125 % faster than pMARS, the '94nop-MARS (Corewar.Benchmarking.MARS_94nop)
is about 50 % faster than pMARS. I hope to increase these values a little
bit in further releases.

Writing PyCorewar would have been almost impossible without the help of the
Core War Community. Special thanks go to

  Sascha Zapf for endlessly running benchmarks and testsuites and providing
  lots of ideas.

  Albert Ma, Nandor Sieben, Stefan Strack and Mintardjo Wangsaw for writing
  pMARS

  M Joonas Pihlaja for writing exhaust, which made it very easy to understand
  the inner workings of a MARS

  Martin Ankerl for writing exhaust-ma, where I have found a lot of ideas
  for optimizing PyCorewar.

  Michal Janeczek for writing fmars, where I have found even more ideas for
  optimizing PyCorewar.

  Paul V-Khoung for several nice chats about optimizing PyCorewar
